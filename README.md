Using parcel bundler, because vscode give me snippets while i use imports

This tutorial gave me a lot about best practices and tips for Phaser 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDOym-mXxO4&list=PLitFP8FdScfHcJQ.

Definitely Phaser is much better for games and for animations (Pixi.JS) look very similar. SO I will try to use less P5.JS for animation, because with mentioned framework you can achieve Game with much less work (if you understand the framework).

Still P5.JS is great for visulalization but not for my projects, I mean games and images dependent animations.
